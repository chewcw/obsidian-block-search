Build an obsidian plugin.
1. It's a search plugin enhancing the existing built-in search capabilities.
2. The search focus on block, where I define a block as the markdown's bullet points. For example:
```markdown
- this is a block
    - this is a nested block
    - another nested block
- this is another block
```
3. The plugin should allow users to search for specific blocks across all notes in their vault.
4. For example, search `block`, the plugin should return two results, the first one is
```
- this is a block
    - this is a nested block
    - another nested block
```
and the second one is
```
- this is another block
```
where all of them have the `block` highlighted.
5. Another example, if I search `a\s`, the plugin should return one result:
```
- this is a block
    - this is a nested block
    - another nested block
```
where `a ` is highlighted in both `a block` and `a nested block`.
6. If I have a note like this:
```markdown
- 07:30 Wake up  [tags:: #journal/lifestyle]
    - this is a test
- 08:00 Breakfast  [tags:: #journal/lifestyle]
    - another test
```
and I search `Wake test`, the plugin should return one result:
```
- 07:30 Wake up  [tags:: #journal/lifestyle]
    - this is a test
```
where `Wake` and `test` are highlighted.
